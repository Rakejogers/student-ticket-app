### Documentation:
- `PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS.md` - Complete technical analysis
- `OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md` - This executive summary

### Configuration:
- Enhanced `next.config.mjs` - Optimized build configuration
- Updated `package.json` - Added performance scripts

## 🚀 How to Use

### Run Performance Analysis:
```bash
npm run analyze
```

### Check Bundle Sizes:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Monitor Performance:
The build output now shows clear bundle sizes for each route, making it easy to spot any regressions.

## ⚠️ One Remaining Opportunity

### Onboarding Page (Optional):
- **Current**: 252 kB (unchanged)
- **Target**: < 180 kB (30% improvement possible)
- **Status**: Not critical, can be addressed later if needed

## 🎓 Key Lessons Learned

1. **Framework Trust**: Next.js defaults often outperform custom configurations
2. **Measurement Matters**: Always measure before and after changes
3. **Component Splitting**: Breaking large components improves both performance and maintainability
4. **Emergency Response**: Quick rollback capabilities are essential

## 📋 Optional Next Steps

If you want to pursue additional optimizations:

### Quick Wins (2-4 hours):
- [ ] Compress image assets (60-80% size reduction possible)
- [ ] Optimize onboarding page component

### Advanced Features (1-2 days):
- [ ] Implement service worker caching
- [ ] Add progressive web app features
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring in CI/CD

### Monitoring Setup (Optional):
- [ ] Add Lighthouse CI for automated performance testing
- [ ] Set up Web Vitals monitoring
